# Numerical Python Assignment by Marc Wilson Flores from 2ECE-C
## Problems 
In this assignment, two problems were given. The first is a normalization problem, where I was tasked to create a random 5x5 ndarray and store it in the variable X, then normalize the array stored in X and save it as _X_normalized.npy_.

For the next problem, I was tasked to create a 10x10 ndarray which contains the squares of the first 100 positive integers. Then, determine the divisible values by 3 and save them as _div_by_3.npy_.

## Background
**First Problem**
In this problem, I could easily produce a random 5x5 ndarray and then input the normalization formula, subtracting the data from the mean divided by the standard deviation.

**Second Problem**
For the second problem, I arranged the 10x10 ndarray of the first 100 positive integers. Then I squared the values in the array, but I got stuck on filtering out the non-divisible values by 3. I used a boolean method to determine if a value is divisible by 3.

## Outputs
Here are the outputs achieved in each problem:
